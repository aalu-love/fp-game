# Asteroid Fighter Game[https://aalu-love.github.io/fp-game]

A classic-style space shooter game where you control a fighter ship and defend against incoming asteroids.

## Description

In this game, you pilot a fighter ship in space, shooting and dodging asteroids. Large asteroids split into multiple medium-sized asteroids when shot, creating an increasingly challenging environment. The game features a health system, score tracking, and high score persistence.

## Features

-   Smooth fighter ship controls with mouse
-   Momentum-based movement with recoil
-   Health system with visual feedback
-   Score system with high score tracking
-   Asteroid splitting mechanics
-   Visual damage indicators
-   Bounded play area

## How to Play

### Controls

-   **Mouse Movement**: Aim the fighter ship
-   **Mouse Click**: Shoot projectiles
-   **Hold Click**: Continuous firing

### Game Mechanics

1. **Movement**

    - The fighter follows your mouse cursor
    - Shooting creates recoil that pushes your ship backward
    - Stay within the red boundary lines

2. **Health System**

    - Start with 100 health
    - Large asteroids deal 40 damage
    - Medium asteroids deal 20 damage
    - Health bar appears above your ship

3. **Scoring**

    - Hit large asteroid: 10 points
    - Destroy medium asteroid: 20 points
    - Each large asteroid can potentially give 70 points total
      (10 for initial hit + 20Ã—3 for medium asteroids)

4. **Asteroids**
    - Large asteroids split into 3 medium asteroids
    - Medium asteroids are destroyed when hit
    - Asteroids spawn from outside the play area

### Game Over Conditions

-   Health reaches 0
-   Ship moves outside the play area
